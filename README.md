## Fullstack JS homework

Welcome to my solution attempt of Kiwi's Fullstack JS homework. The project is structured in two main parts, one is reserved for the frontend and the other is the backend.

### The frontend

Consists of a React application which fetches data (T9 predictive words) from an external service. I tried to bring to the user a similar experience to what they would get when typing using old phone's keyboards.


### The backend

It will provide the service for the frontend to consume.


### Instructions

TBD
